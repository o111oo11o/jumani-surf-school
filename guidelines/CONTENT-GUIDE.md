| **Subheading** | "A small surf school with a big heart, on one of Galle's most beautiful beaches." |

### Block 2: The Story

**Section heading**: "How It All Started"

**Body copy** (2–3 paragraphs):

"Jumani Surf School was born in December 2019 from Mani's lifelong love of the ocean. After years of surfing and teaching across Sri Lanka's south coast, he opened his own school on Dewata Beach — a beautiful bay where palm trees and turquoise water meet local fishing boats and a tight-knit community."

"Dewata Beach sits between Galle Fort and Unawatuna, just a five-minute tuk-tuk ride from both. While the main section of the beach has become popular, Jumani is tucked away at the quieter western end — five minutes' walk from the other schools. This gives our lessons a private, uncrowded feel with plenty of space in the water."

"What makes this spot truly special is the sunset. Facing the full sweep of the bay — from famous Jungle Beach to the iconic Closenburg Hotel viewpoint — our bar has one of the best sunset seats on the south coast. Grab a juice, watch the sky turn gold, and feel why we built this place."

## Content Principles for All Pages

1. **No hardcoded text** — all content comes from Sanity CMS
2. **Every section has a CTA** — always give the visitor a next action
3. **Three services always visible** — header nav + footer + homepage above-fold
4. **WhatsApp is primary contact** — fastest response channel
5. **Prices are CMS-managed** — can be updated without code changes
6. **Testimonials are CMS-managed** — added/rotated from Sanity
7. **FAQ is CMS-managed** — questions can be added per page
8. **Gallery is CMS-managed** — images uploaded to Sanity with tags
9. **Team members are CMS-managed** — bios, photos, roles editable
10. **Spell "coffee" correctly** — the old site uses "coffea" throughout; fix this
